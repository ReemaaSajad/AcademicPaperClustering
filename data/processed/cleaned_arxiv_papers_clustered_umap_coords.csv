Plant Disease Detection using Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network,"Agriculture plays an important role in the food and economy of Bangladesh. The rapid growth of population over the years also has increased the demand for food production. One of the major reasons behind low crop production is numerous bacteria, virus and fungal plant diseases. Early detection of plant diseases and proper usage of pesticides and fertilizers are vital for preventing the diseases and boost the yield. Most of the farmers use generalized pesticides and fertilizers in the entire fields without specifically knowing the condition of the plants. Thus the production cost oftentimes increases, and, not only that, sometimes this becomes detrimental to the yield. Deep Learning models are found to be very effective to automatically detect plant diseases from images of plants, thereby reducing the need for human specialists. This paper aims at building a lightweight deep learning model for predicting leaf disease in tomato plants. By modifying the region-based convolutional neural network, we design an efficient and effective model that demonstrates satisfactory empirical performance on a benchmark dataset. Our proposed model can easily be deployed in a larger system where drones take images of leaves and these images will be fed into our model to know the health condition.","Hasin Rehana, Muhammad Ibrahim, Md.

"A Wireless Collaborated Inference Acceleration Framework for Plant
  Disease Recognition","Plant disease is a critical factor affecting agricultural production. Traditional manual recognition methods face significant drawbacks, including low accuracy, high costs, and inefficiency. Deep learning techniques have demonstrated significant benefits in identifying plant diseases, but they still face challenges such as inference delays and high energy consumption. Deep learning algorithms are difficult to run on resource-limited embedded devices. Offloading these models to cloud servers is confronted with the restriction of communication bandwidth, and all of these factors will influence the inference's efficiency. We propose a collaborative inference framework for recognizing plant diseases between edge devices and cloud servers to enhance inference speed. The DNN model for plant disease recognition is pruned through deep reinforcement learning to improve the inference speed and reduce energy consumption. Then the optimal split point is determined by a greedy strategy to achieve the best collaborated inference acceleration. Finally, the system for collaborative inference acceleration in plant disease recognition has been implemented using Gradio to facilitate friendly human-machine interaction. Experiments indicate that the proposed collaborative inference framework significantly increases inference speed while maintaining acceptable recognition accuracy, offering a novel solution for rapidly diagnosing and preventing plant diseases.","Hele Zhu, Xinyi Huang, Haojia Gao, Mengfei Jiang, Haohua Que, Lei Mu",http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02877v1,arXiv,plant disease is a critical factor affecting agricultural production traditional manual recognition methods face significant drawbacks including low accuracy high costs and inefficiency deep learning techniques have demonstrated significant benefits in identifying plant diseases but they still face challenges such as inference delays and high energy consumption deep learning algorithms are difficult to run on resource-limited embedded devices offloading these models to cloud servers is confronted with the restriction of communication bandwidth and all of these factors will influence the inference s efficiency we propose a collaborative inference framework for recognizing plant diseases between edge devices and cloud servers to enhance inference speed the dnn model for plant disease recognition is pruned through deep reinforcement learning to improve the inference speed and reduce energy consumption then the optimal split point is determined by a greedy strategy to achieve the best collaborated inference acceleration finally the system for collaborative inference acceleration in plant disease recognition has been implemented using gradio to facilitate friendly human-machine interaction experiments indicate that the proposed collaborative inference framework significantly increases inference speed while maintaining acceptable recognition accuracy offering a novel solution for rapidly diagnosing and preventing plant diseases,1,0,9.720022,-3.9108856

"Deep Learning for Plant Identification and Disease Classification from
  Leaf Images: Multi-prediction Approaches","Deep learning plays an important role in modern agriculture, especially in plant pathology using leaf images where convolutional neural networks (CNN) are attracting a lot of attention. While numerous reviews have explored the applications of deep learning within this research domain, there remains a notable absence of an empirical study to offer insightful comparisons due to the employment of varied datasets in the evaluation. Furthermore, a majority of these approaches tend to address the problem as a singular prediction task, overlooking the multifaceted nature of predicting various aspects of plant species and disease types. Lastly, there is an evident need for a more profound consideration of the semantic relationships that underlie plant species and disease types. In this paper, we start our study by surveying current deep learning approaches for plant identification and disease classification. We categorise the approaches into multi-model, multi-label, multi-output, and multi-task, in which different backbone CNNs can be employed. Furthermore, based on the survey of existing approaches in plant pathology and the study of available approaches in machine learning, we propose a new model named Generalised Stacking Multi-output CNN (GSMo-CNN). To investigate the effectiveness of different backbone CNNs and learning approaches, we conduct an intensive experiment on three benchmark datasets Plant Village, Plant Leaves, and PlantDoc. The experimental results demonstrate that InceptionV3 can be a good choice for a backbone CNN as its performance is better than AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet101, EfficientNet, MobileNet, and a custom CNN developed by us. Interestingly, empirical results support the hypothesis that using a single model can be comparable or better than using two models. Finally, we show that the proposed GSMo-CNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets.","Jianping Yao, Son N.

"An Ensemble of Convolutional Neural Networks to Detect Foliar Diseases
  in Apple Plants","Apple diseases, if not diagnosed early, can lead to massive resource loss and pose a serious threat to humans and animals who consume the infected apples. Hence, it is critical to diagnose these diseases early in order to manage plant health and minimize the risks associated with them.

"Explainable vision transformer enabled convolutional neural network for
  plant disease identification: PlantXViT","Plant diseases are the primary cause of crop losses globally, with an impact on the world economy. To deal with these issues, smart agriculture solutions are evolving that combine the Internet of Things and machine learning for early disease detection and control. Many such systems use vision-based machine learning methods for real-time disease detection and diagnosis. With the advancement in deep learning techniques, new methods have emerged that employ convolutional neural networks for plant disease detection and identification. Another trend in vision-based deep learning is the use of vision transformers, which have proved to be powerful models for classification and other problems. However, vision transformers have rarely been investigated for plant pathology applications. In this study, a Vision Transformer enabled Convolutional Neural Network model called ""PlantXViT"" is proposed for plant disease identification. The proposed model combines the capabilities of traditional convolutional neural networks with the Vision Transformers to efficiently identify a large number of plant diseases for several crops. The proposed model has a lightweight structure with only 0.8 million trainable parameters, which makes it suitable for IoT-based smart agriculture services. The performance of PlantXViT is evaluated on five publicly available datasets. The proposed PlantXViT network performs better than five state-of-the-art methods on all five datasets.

"PlantPlotGAN: A Physics-Informed Generative Adversarial Network for
  Plant Disease Prediction","Monitoring plantations is crucial for crop management and producing healthy harvests. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been used to collect multispectral images that aid in this monitoring. However, given the number of hectares to be monitored and the limitations of flight, plant disease signals become visually clear only in the later stages of plant growth and only if the disease has spread throughout a significant portion of the plantation. This limited amount of relevant data hampers the prediction models, as the algorithms struggle to generalize patterns with unbalanced or unrealistic augmented datasets effectively. To address this issue, we propose PlantPlotGAN, a physics-informed generative model capable of creating synthetic multispectral plot images with realistic vegetation indices. These indices served as a proxy for disease detection and were used to evaluate if our model could help increase the accuracy of prediction models. The results demonstrate that the synthetic imagery generated from PlantPlotGAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods regarding the Fr\'echet inception distance.

Multi-output Deep-Supervised Classifier Chains for Plant Pathology,"Plant leaf disease classification is an important task in smart agriculture which plays a critical role in sustainable production. Modern machine learning approaches have shown unprecedented potential in this classification task which offers an array of benefits including time saving and cost reduction. However, most recent approaches directly employ convolutional neural networks where the effect of the relationship between plant species and disease types on prediction performance is not properly studied. In this study, we proposed a new model named Multi-output Deep Supervised Classifier Chains (Mo-DsCC) which weaves the prediction of plant species and disease by chaining the output layers for the two labels.

Adaptive Transfer Learning for Plant Phenotyping,"Plant phenotyping (Guo et al. 2021; Pieruschka et al. 2019) focuses on studying the diverse traits of plants related to the plants' growth. To be more specific, by accurately measuring the plant's anatomical, ontogenetical, physiological and biochemical properties, it allows identifying the crucial factors of plants' growth in different environments. One commonly used approach is to predict the plant's traits using hyperspectral reflectance (Yendrek et al. 2017; Wang et al. 2021). However, the data distributions of the hyperspectral reflectance data in plant phenotyping might vary in different environments for different plants. That is, it would be computationally expansive to learn the machine learning models separately for one plant in different environments. To solve this problem, we focus on studying the knowledge transferability of modern machine learning models in plant phenotyping. More specifically, this work aims to answer the following questions. (1) How is the performance of conventional machine learning models, e.g., partial least squares regression (PLSR), Gaussian process regression (GPR) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP), affected by the number of annotated samples for plant phenotyping? (2) Whether could the neural network based transfer learning models improve the performance of plant phenotyping?

Moreover, crop failure due to disease causes a significant loss to the farmers, as well as the consumers. While there have been recent developments in the automated detection of these diseases using Machine Learning techniques, the utilization of Deep Learning has not been fully explored. Additionally, such models are not easy to use because of the high-quality data used in their training, lack of computational power, and poor generalizability of the models. To this end, we create an open-source easy-to-use web application to address some of these issues which may help improve crop production.

"Unsupervised deep learning techniques for powdery mildew recognition
  based on multispectral imaging","Objectives. Sustainable management of plant diseases is an open challenge which has relevant economic and environmental impact. Optimal strategies rely on human expertise for field scouting under favourable conditions to assess the current presence and extent of disease symptoms. This labor-intensive task is complicated by the large field area to be scouted, combined with the millimeter-scale size of the early symptoms to be detected. In view of this, image-based detection of early disease symptoms is an attractive approach to automate this process, enabling a potential high throughput monitoring at sustainable costs.   Methods. Deep learning has been successfully applied in various domains to obtain an automatic selection of the relevant image features by learning filters via a training procedure. Deep learning has recently entered also the domain of plant disease detection: following this idea, in this work we present a deep learning approach to automatically recognize powdery mildew on cucumber leaves. We focus on unsupervised deep learning techniques applied to multispectral imaging data and we propose the use of autoencoder architectures to investigate two strategies for disease detection: i) clusterization of features in a compressed space; ii) anomaly detection.   Results. The two proposed approaches have been assessed by quantitative indices. The clusterization approach is not fully capable by itself to provide accurate predictions but it does cater relevant information. Anomaly detection has instead a significant potential of resolution which could be further exploited as a prior for supervised architectures with a very limited number of labeled samples.","Alessandro Benfenati, Paola Causin, Roberto Oberti, Giovanni Stefanello",http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11242v1,arXiv,objectives sustainable management of plant diseases is an open challenge which has relevant economic and environmental impact optimal strategies rely on human expertise for field scouting under favourable conditions to assess the current presence and extent of disease symptoms this labor-intensive task is complicated by the large field area to be scouted combined with the millimeter-scale size of the early symptoms to be detected in view of this image-based detection of early disease symptoms is an attractive approach to automate this process enabling a potential high throughput monitoring at sustainable costs methods deep learning has been successfully applied in various domains to obtain an automatic selection of the relevant image features by learning filters via a training procedure deep learning has recently entered also the domain of plant disease detection following this idea in this work we present a deep learning approach to automatically recognize powdery mildew on cucumber leaves we focus on unsupervised deep learning techniques applied to multispectral imaging data and we propose the use of autoencoder architectures to investigate two strategies for disease detection i clusterization of features in a compressed space ii anomaly detection results the two proposed approaches have been assessed by quantitative indices the clusterization approach is not fully capable by itself to provide accurate predictions but it does cater relevant information anomaly detection has instead a significant potential of resolution which could be further exploited as a prior for supervised architectures with a very limited number of labeled samples,1,0,8.363372,-4.463124

DDD: Discriminative Difficulty Distance for plant disease diagnosis,"Recent studies on plant disease diagnosis using machine learning (ML) have highlighted concerns about the overestimated diagnostic performance due to inappropriate data partitioning, where training and test datasets are derived from the same source (domain). Plant disease diagnosis presents a challenging classification task, characterized by its fine-grained nature, vague symptoms, and the extensive variability of image features within each domain. In this study, we propose the concept of Discriminative Difficulty Distance (DDD), a novel metric designed to quantify the domain gap between training and test datasets while assessing the classification difficulty of test data. DDD provides a valuable tool for identifying insufficient diversity in training data, thus supporting the development of more diverse and robust datasets. We investigated multiple image encoders trained on different datasets and examined whether the distances between datasets, measured using low-dimensional representations generated by the encoders, are suitable as a DDD metric.

  Graph Convolutional Network","Crop yield production could be enhanced for agricultural growth if various plant nutrition deficiencies, and diseases are identified and detected at early stages. The deep learning methods have proven its superior performances in the automated detection of plant diseases and nutrition deficiencies from visual symptoms in leaves. This article proposes a new deep learning method for plant nutrition deficiencies and disease classification using a graph convolutional network (GNN), added upon a base convolutional neural network (CNN). Sometimes, a global feature descriptor might fail to capture the vital region of a diseased leaf, which causes inaccurate classification of disease.

In this work, region-based feature summarization at multi-scales is explored using spatial pyramidal pooling for discriminative feature representation. A GCN is developed to capacitate learning of finer details for classifying plant diseases and insufficiency of nutrients.

Particularly, hyperspectral imagery (HSI) combining with machine learning/deep learning approaches is preferable for accurately identifying specific plant diseases because the HSI consists of a wide range of high-quality reflectance information beyond human vision, capable of capturing both spectral-spatial information. The proposed method considers the potential disease specific reflectance radiation variance caused by the canopy structural diversity, introduces the multiple capsule layers to model the hierarchical structure of the spectral-spatial disease attributes with the encapsulated features to represent the various classes and the rotation invariance of the disease attributes in the feature space. We have evaluated the proposed method with the real UAV-based HSI data under the controlled field conditions. The effectiveness of the hierarchical features has been quantitatively assessed and compared with the existing representative machine learning/deep learning methods. The experiment results show that the proposed model significantly improves the accuracy performance when considering hierarchical-structure of spectral-spatial features, comparing to the existing methods only using spectral, or spatial or spectral-spatial features without consider hierarchical-structure of spectral-spatial features.","Yue Shi, Liangxiu Han, Anthony Kleerekoper, Sheng Chang, Tongle Hu",http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.13277v1,arXiv,late blight disease is one of the most destructive diseases in potato crop leading to serious yield losses globally accurate diagnosis of the disease at early stage is critical for precision disease control and management current farm practices in crop disease diagnosis are based on manual visual inspection which is costly time consuming subject to individual bias recent advances in imaging sensors e g rgb multiple spectral and hyperspectral cameras remote sensing and machine learning offer the opportunity to address this challenge particularly hyperspectral imagery hsi combining with machine learning deep learning approaches is preferable for accurately identifying specific plant diseases because the hsi consists of a wide range of high-quality reflectance information beyond human vision capable of capturing both spectral-spatial information the proposed method considers the potential disease specific reflectance radiation variance caused by the canopy structural diversity introduces the multiple capsule layers to model the hierarchical structure of the spectral-spatial disease attributes with the encapsulated features to represent the various classes and the rotation invariance of the disease attributes in the feature space we have evaluated the proposed method with the real uav-based hsi data under the controlled field conditions the effectiveness of the hierarchical features has been quantitatively assessed and compared with the existing representative machine learning deep learning methods the experiment results show that the proposed model significantly improves the accuracy performance when considering hierarchical-structure of spectral-spatial features comparing to the existing methods only using spectral or spatial or spectral-spatial features without consider hierarchical-structure of spectral-spatial features,1,0,8.480356,-3.4085157

"Deep Belief Network based representation learning for lncRNA-disease
  association prediction","Background: The expanding research in the field of long non-coding RNAs(lncRNAs) showed abnormal expression of lncRNAs in many complex diseases. Accurately identifying lncRNA-disease association is essential in understanding lncRNA functionality and disease mechanism. There are many machine learning techniques involved in the prediction of lncRNA-disease association which use different biological interaction networks and associated features. Feature learning from the network structured data is one of the limiting factors of machine learning-based methods. Graph neural network based techniques solve this limitation by unsupervised feature learning. Deep belief networks (DBN) are recently used in biological network analysis to learn the latent representations of network features.   Method: In this paper, we propose a DBN based lncRNA-disease association prediction model (DBNLDA) from lncRNA, disease and miRNA interactions. The architecture contains three major modules-network construction, DBN based feature learning and neural network-based prediction. First, we constructed three heterogeneous networks such as lncRNA-miRNA similarity (LMS), disease-miRNA similarity (DMS) and lncRNA-disease association (LDA) network. From the node embedding matrices of similarity networks, lncRNA-disease representations were learned separately by two DBN based subnetworks. The joint representation of lncRNA-disease was learned by a third DBN from outputs of the two subnetworks mentioned. This joint feature representation was used to predict the association score by an ANN classifier.   Result: The proposed method obtained AUC of 0.96 and AUPR of 0.967 when tested against standard dataset used by the state-of-the-art methods. Analysis on breast, lung and stomach cancer cases also affirmed the effectiveness of DBNLDA in predicting significant lncRNA-disease associations.","Manu Madhavan, Gopakumar G",http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.12534v1,arXiv,background the expanding research in the field of long non-coding rnas lncrnas showed abnormal expression of lncrnas in many complex diseases accurately identifying lncrna-disease association is essential in understanding lncrna functionality and disease mechanism there are many machine learning techniques involved in the prediction of lncrna-disease association which use different biological interaction networks and associated features feature learning from the network structured data is one of the limiting factors of machine learning-based methods graph neural network based techniques solve this limitation by unsupervised feature learning deep belief networks dbn are recently used in biological network analysis to learn the latent representations of network features method in this paper we propose a dbn based lncrna-disease association prediction model dbnlda from lncrna disease and mirna interactions the architecture contains three major modules-network construction dbn based feature learning and neural network-based prediction first we constructed three heterogeneous networks such as lncrna-mirna similarity lms disease-mirna similarity dms and lncrna-disease association lda network from the node embedding matrices of similarity networks lncrna-disease representations were learned separately by two dbn based subnetworks the joint representation of lncrna-disease was learned by a third dbn from outputs of the two subnetworks mentioned this joint feature representation was used to predict the association score by an ann classifier result the proposed method obtained auc of 0 96 and aupr of 0 967 when tested against standard dataset used by the state-of-the-art methods analysis on breast lung and stomach cancer cases also affirmed the effectiveness of dbnlda in predicting significant lncrna-disease associations,0,1,10.3856945,-0.6647719
"A fast accurate fine-grain object detection model based on YOLOv4 deep
  neural network","Early identification and prevention of various plant diseases in commercial farms and orchards is a key feature of precision agriculture technology. This paper presents a high-performance real-time fine-grain object detection framework that addresses several obstacles in plant disease detection that hinder the performance of traditional methods, such as, dense distribution, irregular morphology, multi-scale object classes, textural similarity, etc. The proposed model is built on an improved version of the You Only Look Once (YOLOv4) algorithm. The modified network architecture maximizes both detection accuracy and speed by including the DenseNet in the back-bone to optimize feature transfer and reuse, two new residual blocks in the backbone and neck enhance feature extraction and reduce computing cost; the Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) enhances receptive field, and a modified Path Aggregation Network (PANet) preserves fine-grain localized information and improve feature fusion. Additionally, the use of the Hard-Swish function as the primary activation improved the model's accuracy due to better nonlinear feature extraction. The proposed model is tested in detecting four different diseases in tomato plants under various challenging environments. The model outperforms the existing state-of-the-art detection models in detection accuracy and speed. At a detection rate of 70.19 FPS, the proposed model obtained a precision value of $90.33 \%$, F1-score of $93.64 \%$, and a mean average precision ($mAP$) value of $96.29 \%$.

In existing work, robots have mostly influenced group behaviors of animals. We explore the possibilities of mixing robots with natural plants, merging useful attributes. Significant synergies arise by combining the plants' ability to efficiently produce shaped material and the robots' ability to extend sensing and decision-making behaviors. However, programming robots to control plant motion and shape requires good knowledge of complex plant behaviors. Therefore, we use machine learning to create a holistic plant model and evolve robot controllers. As a benchmark task we choose obstacle avoidance. We use computer vision to construct a model of plant stem stiffening and motion dynamics by training an LSTM network. The LSTM network acts as a forward model predicting change in the plant, driving the evolution of neural network robot controllers.

An efficient plant disease detection using transfer learning approach,"Plant diseases pose significant challenges to farmers and the agricultural sector at large. However, early detection of plant diseases is crucial to mitigating their effects and preventing widespread damage, as outbreaks can severely impact the productivity and quality of crops. With advancements in technology, there are increasing opportunities for automating the monitoring and detection of disease outbreaks in plants. This study proposed a system designed to identify and monitor plant diseases using a transfer learning approach. Specifically, the study utilizes YOLOv7 and YOLOv8, two state-ofthe-art models in the field of object detection. By fine-tuning these models on a dataset of plant leaf images, the system is able to accurately detect the presence of Bacteria, Fungi and Viral diseases such as Powdery Mildew, Angular Leaf Spot, Early blight and Tomato mosaic virus.

"A Multi-Plant Disease Diagnosis Method using Convolutional Neural
  Network","A disease that limits a plant from its maximal capacity is defined as plant disease. From the perspective of agriculture, diagnosing plant disease is crucial, as diseases often limit plants' production capacity. However, manual approaches to recognize plant diseases are often temporal, challenging, and time-consuming. Therefore, computerized recognition of plant diseases is highly desired in the field of agricultural automation. Due to the recent improvement of computer vision, identifying diseases using leaf images of a particular plant has already been introduced. Nevertheless, the most introduced model can only diagnose diseases of a specific plant. Hence, in this chapter, we investigate an optimal plant disease identification model combining the diagnosis of multiple plants. Despite relying on multi-class classification, the model inherits a multilabel classification method to identify the plant and the type of disease in parallel. For the experiment and evaluation, we collected data from various online sources that included leaf images of six plants, including tomato, potato, rice, corn, grape, and apple. In our investigation, we implement numerous popular convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. The experimental results validate that the Xception and DenseNet architectures perform better in multi-label plant disease classification tasks. Through architectural investigation, we imply that skip connections, spatial convolutions, and shorter hidden layer connectivity cause better results in plant disease classification.","Muhammad Mohsin Kabir, Abu Quwsar Ohi, M.

"A Deep Learning-based Detector for Brown Spot Disease in Passion Fruit
  Plant Leaves","Pests and diseases pose a key challenge to passion fruit farmers across Uganda and East Africa in general. They lead to loss of investment as yields reduce and losses increases.

"Transferring Graph Neural Networks for Soft Sensor Modeling using
  Process Topologies","Data-driven soft sensors help in process operations by providing real-time estimates of otherwise hard- to-measure process quantities, e.g., viscosities or product concentrations. Currently, soft sensors need to be developed individually per plant. Using transfer learning, machine learning-based soft sensors could be reused and fine-tuned across plants and applications. However, transferring data-driven soft sensor models is in practice often not possible, because the fixed input structure of standard soft sensor models prohibits transfer if, e.g., the sensor information is not identical in all plants. We propose a topology-aware graph neural network approach for transfer learning of soft sensor models across multiple plants. In our method, plants are modeled as graphs: Unit operations are nodes, streams are edges, and sensors are embedded as attributes. Our approach brings two advantages for transfer learning: First, we not only include sensor data but also crucial information on the plant topology. Second, the graph neural network algorithm is flexible with respect to its sensor inputs. This allows us to model data from different plants with different sensor networks. We test the transfer learning capabilities of our modeling approach on ammonia synthesis loops with different process topologies. We build a soft sensor predicting the ammonia concentration in the product. After training on data from one process, we successfully transfer our soft sensor model to a previously unseen process with a different topology. Our approach promises to extend the data-driven soft sensors to cases to leverage data from multiple plants.","Maximilian F. Theisen, Gabrie M. H. Meesters, Artur M.

"Paddy Disease Detection and Classification Using Computer Vision
  Techniques: A Mobile Application to Detect Paddy Disease","Plant diseases significantly impact our food supply, causing problems for farmers, economies reliant on agriculture, and global food security.

Push Past Green: Learning to Look Behind Plant Foliage by Moving It,"Autonomous agriculture applications (e.g., inspection, phenotyping, plucking fruits) require manipulating the plant foliage to look behind the leaves and the branches. Partial visibility, extreme clutter, thin structures, and unknown geometry and dynamics for plants make such manipulation challenging. We tackle these challenges through data-driven methods. We use self-supervision to train SRPNet, a neural network that predicts what space is revealed on execution of a candidate action on a given plant. We use SRPNet with the cross-entropy method to predict actions that are effective at revealing space beneath plant foliage. Furthermore, as SRPNet does not just predict how much space is revealed but also where it is revealed, we can execute a sequence of actions that incrementally reveal more and more space beneath the plant foliage.

"Context-aware Health Event Prediction via Transition Functions on
  Dynamic Disease Graphs","With the wide application of electronic health records (EHR) in healthcare facilities, health event prediction with deep learning has gained more and more attention. A common feature of EHR data used for deep-learning-based predictions is historical diagnoses. Existing work mainly regards a diagnosis as an independent disease and does not consider clinical relations among diseases in a visit. Many machine learning approaches assume disease representations are static in different visits of a patient. However, in real practice, multiple diseases that are frequently diagnosed at the same time reflect hidden patterns that are conducive to prognosis. Moreover, the development of a disease is not static since some diseases can emerge or disappear and show various symptoms in different visits of a patient. To effectively utilize this combinational disease information and explore the dynamics of diseases, we propose a novel context-aware learning framework using transition functions on dynamic disease graphs. Specifically, we construct a global disease co-occurrence graph with multiple node properties for disease combinations. We design dynamic subgraphs for each patient's visit to leverage global and local contexts. We further define three diagnosis roles in each visit based on the variation of node properties to model disease transition processes.

"Intelligent Monitoring of Stress Induced by Water Deficiency in Plants
  using Deep Learning","In the recent decade, high-throughput plant phenotyping techniques, which combine non-invasive image analysis and machine learning, have been successfully applied to identify and quantify plant health and diseases. However, these techniques usually do not consider the progressive nature of plant stress and often require images showing severe signs of stress to ensure high confidence detection, thereby reducing the feasibility for early detection and recovery of plants under stress. To overcome the problem mentioned above, we propose a deep learning pipeline for the temporal analysis of the visual changes induced in the plant due to stress and apply it to the specific water stress identification case in Chickpea plant shoot images. For this, we have considered an image dataset of two chickpea varieties JG-62 and Pusa-372, under three water stress conditions; control, young seedling, and before flowering, captured over five months. We have employed a variant of Convolutional Neural Network - Long Short Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) network to learn spatio-temporal patterns from the chickpea plant dataset and use them for water stress classification. Our model has achieved ceiling level classification performance of 98.52% on JG-62 and 97.78% on Pusa-372 chickpea plant data and has outperformed the best reported time-invariant technique by at least 14% for both JG-62 and Pusa-372 species, to the best of our knowledge. Furthermore, our CNN-LSTM model has demonstrated robustness to noisy input, with a less than 2.5% dip in average model accuracy and a small standard deviation about the mean for both species.

"Interpretable Disease Prediction based on Reinforcement Path Reasoning
  over Knowledge Graphs","Objective: To combine medical knowledge and medical data to interpretably predict the risk of disease. Methods: We formulated the disease prediction task as a random walk along a knowledge graph (KG). Specifically, we build a KG to record relationships between diseases and risk factors according to validated medical knowledge. Then, a mathematical object walks along the KG. It starts walking at a patient entity, which connects the KG based on the patient current diseases or risk factors and stops at a disease entity, which represents the predicted disease. The trajectory generated by the object represents an interpretable disease progression path of the given patient. The dynamics of the object are controlled by a policy-based reinforcement learning (RL) module, which is trained by electronic health records (EHRs).

By combining two machine vision algorithms, YOLOv8 and DeepSORT, the system efficiently identifies and tracks individual leaves, extracting the optimal images for health analysis. YOLOv8, chosen for its speed and computational efficiency, locates leaves, while DeepSORT ensures robust tracking in complex environments. For detailed health assessment, DeepLabV3Plus, a convolutional neural network, is employed to segment and quantify leaf damage caused by bacteria, pests, and fungi. The hybrid system, named Plant Doctor, has been trained and validated using a diverse dataset including footage from Tokyo urban plants. The results demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the system in diagnosing leaf damage, with potential applications in large scale urban flora illness monitoring.

"Cross-Validation for Training and Testing Co-occurrence Network
  Inference Algorithms","Microorganisms are found in almost every environment, including the soil, water, air, and inside other organisms, like animals and plants. While some microorganisms cause diseases, most of them help in biological processes such as decomposition, fermentation and nutrient cycling. A lot of research has gone into studying microbial communities in various environments and how their interactions and relationships can provide insights into various diseases. Co-occurrence network inference algorithms help us understand the complex associations of micro-organisms, especially bacteria. Existing network inference algorithms employ techniques such as correlation, regularized linear regression, and conditional dependence, which have different hyper-parameters that determine the sparsity of the network. Previous methods for evaluating the quality of the inferred network include using external data, and network consistency across sub-samples, both which have several drawbacks that limit their applicability in real microbiome composition data sets. We propose a novel cross-validation method to evaluate co-occurrence network inference algorithms, and new methods for applying existing algorithms to predict on test data. Our empirical study shows that the proposed method is useful for hyper-parameter selection (training) and comparing the quality of the inferred networks between different algorithms (testing).","Daniel Agyapong, Jeffrey Ryan Propster, Jane Marks, Toby Dylan Hocking",http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15225v1,arXiv,microorganisms are found in almost every environment including the soil water air and inside other organisms like animals and plants while some microorganisms cause diseases most of them help in biological processes such as decomposition fermentation and nutrient cycling a lot of research has gone into studying microbial communities in various environments and how their interactions and relationships can provide insights into various diseases co-occurrence network inference algorithms help us understand the complex associations of micro-organisms especially bacteria existing network inference algorithms employ techniques such as correlation regularized linear regression and conditional dependence which have different hyper-parameters that determine the sparsity of the network previous methods for evaluating the quality of the inferred network include using external data and network consistency across sub-samples both which have several drawbacks that limit their applicability in real microbiome composition data sets we propose a novel cross-validation method to evaluate co-occurrence network inference algorithms and new methods for applying existing algorithms to predict on test data our empirical study shows that the proposed method is useful for hyper-parameter selection training and comparing the quality of the inferred networks between different algorithms testing,7,0,10.220012,-1.0731791
"MobilePlantViT: A Mobile-friendly Hybrid ViT for Generalized Plant
  Disease Image Classification","Plant diseases significantly threaten global food security by reducing crop yields and undermining agricultural sustainability. AI-driven automated classification has emerged as a promising solution, with deep learning models demonstrating impressive performance in plant disease identification.

"Multi-task Learning via Adaptation to Similar Tasks for Mortality
  Prediction of Diverse Rare Diseases","Mortality prediction of diverse rare diseases using electronic health record (EHR) data is a crucial task for intelligent healthcare. However, data insufficiency and the clinical diversity of rare diseases make it hard for directly training deep learning models on individual disease data or all the data from different diseases. Mortality prediction for these patients with different diseases can be viewed as a multi-task learning problem with insufficient data and large task number. But the tasks with little training data also make it hard to train task-specific modules in multi-task learning models. To address the challenges of data insufficiency and task diversity, we propose an initialization-sharing multi-task learning method (Ada-Sit) which learns the parameter initialization for fast adaptation to dynamically measured similar tasks. We use Ada-Sit to train long short-term memory networks (LSTM) based prediction models on longitudinal EHR data.

"Machine learning augmented diagnostic testing to identify sources of
  variability in test performance","Diagnostic tests which can detect pre-clinical or sub-clinical infection, are one of the most powerful tools in our armoury of weapons to control infectious diseases. Considerable effort has been therefore paid to improving diagnostic testing for human, plant and animal diseases, including strategies for targeting the use of diagnostic tests towards individuals who are more likely to be infected. Here, we follow other recent proposals to further refine this concept, by using machine learning to assess the situational risk under which a diagnostic test is applied to augment its interpretation . We develop this to predict the occurrence of breakdowns of cattle herds due to bovine tuberculosis, exploiting the availability of exceptionally detailed testing records. We show that, without compromising test specificity, test sensitivity can be improved so that the proportion of infected herds detected by the skin test, improves by over 16 percentage points. While many risk factors are associated with increased risk of becoming infected, of note are several factors which suggest that, in some herds there is a higher risk of infection going undetected, including effects that are correlated to the veterinary practice conducting the test, and number of livestock moved off the herd.","Christopher J.

"A Systematic Evaluation of Knowledge Graph Embeddings for Gene-Disease
  Association Prediction","Discovery gene-disease links is important in biology and medicine areas, enabling disease identification and drug repurposing. Machine learning approaches accelerate this process by leveraging biological knowledge represented in ontologies and the structure of knowledge graphs. Still, many existing works overlook ontologies explicitly representing diseases, missing causal and semantic relationships between them. The gene-disease association problem naturally frames itself as a link prediction task, where embedding algorithms directly predict associations by exploring the structure and properties of the knowledge graph. Some works frame it as a node-pair classification task, combining embedding algorithms with traditional machine learning algorithms. This strategy aligns with the logic of a machine learning pipeline. However, the use of negative examples and the lack of validated gene-disease associations to train embedding models may constrain its effectiveness. This work introduces a novel framework for comparing the performance of link prediction versus node-pair classification tasks, analyses the performance of state of the art gene-disease association approaches, and compares the different order-based formalizations of gene-disease association prediction. It also evaluates the impact of the semantic richness through a disease-specific ontology and additional links between ontologies. The framework involves five steps: data splitting, knowledge graph integration, embedding, modeling and prediction, and method evaluation. Results show that enriching the semantic representation of diseases slightly improves performance, while additional links generate a greater impact. Link prediction methods better explore the semantic richness encoded in knowledge graphs. Although node-pair classification methods identify all true positives, link prediction methods outperform overall.","Catarina Canastra, Cátia Pesquita",http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08445v1,arXiv,discovery gene-disease links is important in biology and medicine areas enabling disease identification and drug repurposing machine learning approaches accelerate this process by leveraging biological knowledge represented in ontologies and the structure of knowledge graphs still many existing works overlook ontologies explicitly representing diseases missing causal and semantic relationships between them the gene-disease association problem naturally frames itself as a link prediction task where embedding algorithms directly predict associations by exploring the structure and properties of the knowledge graph some works frame it as a node-pair classification task combining embedding algorithms with traditional machine learning algorithms this strategy aligns with the logic of a machine learning pipeline however the use of negative examples and the lack of validated gene-disease associations to train embedding models may constrain its effectiveness this work introduces a novel framework for comparing the performance of link prediction versus node-pair classification tasks analyses the performance of state of the art gene-disease association approaches and compares the different order-based formalizations of gene-disease association prediction it also evaluates the impact of the semantic richness through a disease-specific ontology and additional links between ontologies the framework involves five steps data splitting knowledge graph integration embedding modeling and prediction and method evaluation results show that enriching the semantic representation of diseases slightly improves performance while additional links generate a greater impact link prediction methods better explore the semantic richness encoded in knowledge graphs although node-pair classification methods identify all true positives link prediction methods outperform overall,5,1,10.550068,-0.21838167
"Plant Species Classification Using Transfer Learning by Pretrained

Plant recognition is one of the areas where image classification can be used to identify plant species through their leaves. Botanists devote a significant amount of time to recognizing plant species by personally inspecting. This paper describes a method for dissecting color images of Swedish leaves and identifying plant species. To achieve higher accuracy, the task is completed using transfer learning with the help of pre-trained classifier VGG-19. The four primary processes of classification are image preprocessing, image augmentation, feature extraction, and recognition, which are performed as part of the overall model evaluation. The VGG-19 classifier grasps the characteristics of leaves by employing pre-defined hidden layers such as convolutional layers, max pooling layers, and fully connected layers, and finally uses the soft-max layer to generate a feature representation for all plant classes.

Concept explainability for plant diseases classification,"Plant diseases remain a considerable threat to food security and agricultural sustainability. Rapid and early identification of these diseases has become a significant concern motivating several studies to rely on the increasing global digitalization and the recent advances in computer vision based on deep learning. In fact, plant disease classification based on deep convolutional neural networks has shown impressive performance. However, these methods have yet to be adopted globally due to concerns regarding their robustness, transparency, and the lack of explainability compared with their human experts counterparts. Methods such as saliency-based approaches associating the network output to perturbations of the input pixels have been proposed to give insights into these algorithms. Still, they are not easily comprehensible and not intuitive for human users and are threatened by bias. In this work, we deploy a method called Testing with Concept Activation Vectors (TCAV) that shifts the focus from pixels to user-defined concepts.

Computational Approaches for Disease Gene Identification,"Identifying disease genes from human genome is an important and fundamental problem in biomedical research. Despite many publications of machine learning methods applied to discover new disease genes, it still remains a challenge because of the pleiotropy of genes, the limited number of confirmed disease genes among whole genome and the genetic heterogeneity of diseases. Recent approaches have applied the concept of 'guilty by association' to investigate the association between a disease phenotype and its causative genes, which means that candidate genes with similar characteristics as known disease genes are more likely to be associated with diseases. However, due to the imbalance issues (few genes are experimentally confirmed as disease related genes within human genome) in disease gene identification, semi-supervised approaches, like label propagation approaches and positive-unlabeled learning, are used to identify candidate disease genes via making use of unknown genes for training - typically in the scenario of a small amount of confirmed disease genes (labeled data) with a large amount of unknown genome (unlabeled data). The performance of Disease gene prediction models are limited by potential bias of single learning models and incompleteness and noise of single biological data sources, therefore ensemble learning models are applied via combining multiple diverse biological sources and learning models to obtain better predictive performance.

"An Improved Approach for Prediction of Parkinson's Disease using Machine
  Learning Techniques","Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the major public health problems in the world. It is a well-known fact that around one million people suffer from Parkinson's disease in the United States whereas the number of people suffering from Parkinson's disease worldwide is around 5 million. Thus, it is important to predict Parkinson's disease in early stages so that early plan for the necessary treatment can be made. People are mostly familiar with the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, however, an increasing amount of research is being done to predict the Parkinson's disease from non-motor symptoms that precede the motor ones. If an early and reliable prediction is possible then a patient can get a proper treatment at the right time. Nonmotor symptoms considered are Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep Behaviour Disorder (RBD) and olfactory loss. Developing machine learning models that can help us in predicting the disease can play a vital role in early prediction. In this paper, we extend a work which used the non-motor features such as RBD and olfactory loss. Along with this the extended work also uses important biomarkers. In this paper, we try to model this classifier using different machine learning models that have not been used before. We developed automated diagnostic models using Multilayer Perceptron, BayesNet, Random Forest and Boosted Logistic Regression. It has been observed that Boosted Logistic Regression provides the best performance with an impressive accuracy of 97.159 % and the area under the ROC curve was 98.9%.

"Exploring the Feasibility of Deep Learning Models for Long-term Disease
  Prediction: A Case Study for Wheat Yellow Rust in England","Wheat yellow rust, caused by the fungus Puccinia striiformis, is a critical disease affecting wheat crops across Britain, leading to significant yield losses and economic consequences. Given the rapid environmental changes and the evolving virulence of pathogens, there is a growing need for innovative approaches to predict and manage such diseases over the long term. This study explores the feasibility of using deep learning models to predict outbreaks of wheat yellow rust in British fields, offering a proactive approach to disease management. We construct a yellow rust dataset with historial weather information and disease indicator acrossing multiple regions in England.

The performance of these models with different predictive time steps are evaluated based on their accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Preliminary results indicate that deep learning models can effectively capture the complex interactions between multiple factors influencing disease dynamics, demonstrating a promising capacity to forecast wheat yellow rust with considerable accuracy. Specifically, the fully-connected neural network achieved 83.65% accuracy in a disease prediction task with 6 month predictive time step setup.

"Early Detection of Coffee Leaf Rust Through Convolutional Neural
  Networks Trained on Low-Resolution Images","Coffee leaf rust, a foliar disease caused by the fungus Hemileia vastatrix, poses a major threat to coffee production, especially in Central America. Climate change further aggravates this issue, as it shortens the latency period between initial infection and the emergence of visible symptoms in diseases like leaf rust. Shortened latency periods can lead to more severe plant epidemics and faster spread of diseases. There is, hence, an urgent need for effective disease management strategies. To address these challenges, we explore the potential of deep learning models for enhancing early disease detection. However, deep learning models require extensive processing power and large amounts of data for model training, resources that are typically scarce. To overcome these barriers, we propose a preprocessing technique that involves convolving training images with a high-pass filter to enhance lesion-leaf contrast, significantly improving model efficacy in resource-limited environments. This method and our model demonstrated a strong performance, achieving over 90% across all evaluation metrics--including precision, recall, F1-score, and the Dice coefficient.

"Improving FHB Screening in Wheat Breeding Using an Efficient Transformer
  Model","Fusarium head blight is a devastating disease that causes significant economic losses annually on small grains. Efficiency, accuracy, and timely detection of FHB in the resistance screening are critical for wheat and barley breeding programs. In recent years, various image processing techniques have been developed using supervised machine learning algorithms for the early detection of FHB. The state-of-the-art convolutional neural network-based methods, such as U-Net, employ a series of encoding blocks to create a local representation and a series of decoding blocks to capture the semantic relations. However, these methods are not often capable of long-range modeling dependencies inside the input data, and their ability to model multi-scale objects with significant variations in texture and shape is limited. Vision transformers as alternative architectures with innate global self-attention mechanisms for sequence-to-sequence prediction, due to insufficient low-level details, may also limit localization capabilities. To overcome these limitations, a new Context Bridge is proposed to integrate the local representation capability of the U-Net network in the transformer model. In addition, the standard attention mechanism of the original transformer is replaced with Efficient Self-attention, which is less complicated than other state-of-the-art methods. To train the proposed network, 12,000 wheat images from an FHB-inoculated wheat field at the SDSU research farm in Volga, SD, were captured. In addition to healthy and unhealthy plants, these images encompass various stages of the disease. A team of expert pathologists annotated the images for training and evaluating the developed model. As a result, the effectiveness of the transformer-based method for FHB-disease detection, through extensive experiments across typical tasks for plant image segmentation, is demonstrated.","Babak Azad, Ahmed Abdalla, Kwanghee Won, Ali Mirzakhani Nafchi",http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03670v1,arXiv,fusarium head blight is a devastating disease that causes significant economic losses annually on small grains efficiency accuracy and timely detection of fhb in the resistance screening are critical for wheat and barley breeding programs in recent years various image processing techniques have been developed using supervised machine learning algorithms for the early detection of fhb the state-of-the-art convolutional neural network-based methods such as u-net employ a series of encoding blocks to create a local representation and a series of decoding blocks to capture the semantic relations however these methods are not often capable of long-range modeling dependencies inside the input data and their ability to model multi-scale objects with significant variations in texture and shape is limited vision transformers as alternative architectures with innate global self-attention mechanisms for sequence-to-sequence prediction due to insufficient low-level details may also limit localization capabilities to overcome these limitations a new context bridge is proposed to integrate the local representation capability of the u-net network in the transformer model in addition the standard attention mechanism of the original transformer is replaced with efficient self-attention which is less complicated than other state-of-the-art methods to train the proposed network 12 000 wheat images from an fhb-inoculated wheat field at the sdsu research farm in volga sd were captured in addition to healthy and unhealthy plants these images encompass various stages of the disease a team of expert pathologists annotated the images for training and evaluating the developed model as a result the effectiveness of the transformer-based method for fhb-disease detection through extensive experiments across typical tasks for plant image segmentation is demonstrated,4,0,10.327362,-4.6709037
"Learning the progression and clinical subtypes of Alzheimer's disease

The clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease are characterized by heterogeneity in age, disease span, progression rate, impairment of memory and cognitive abilities. Due to these variabilities, personalized care and treatment planning, as well as patient counseling about their individual progression is limited. Recent developments in machine learning to detect hidden patterns in complex, multi-dimensional datasets provides significant opportunities to address this critical need.

"Rectified Meta-Learning from Noisy Labels for Robust Image-based Plant
  Disease Diagnosis","Plant diseases serve as one of main threats to food security and crop production. It is thus valuable to exploit recent advances of artificial intelligence to assist plant disease diagnosis. One popular approach is to transform this problem as a leaf image classification task, which can be then addressed by the powerful convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, the performance of CNN-based classification approach depends on a large amount of high-quality manually labeled training data, which are inevitably introduced noise on labels in practice, leading to model overfitting and performance degradation.

"Predicting the Plant Root-Associated Ecological Niche of 21 Pseudomonas
  Species Using Machine Learning and Metabolic Modeling","Plants rarely occur in isolated systems. Bacteria can inhabit either the endosphere, the region inside the plant root, or the rhizosphere, the soil region just outside the plant root. Our goal is to understand if using genomic data and media dependent metabolic model information is better for training machine learning of predicting bacterial ecological niche than media independent models or pure genome based species trees. We considered three machine learning techniques: support vector machine, non-negative matrix factorization, and artificial neural networks. In all three machine-learning approaches, the media-based metabolic models and flux balance analyses were more effective at predicting bacterial niche than the genome or PRMT models. Support Vector Machine trained on a minimal media base with Mannose, Proline and Valine was most predictive of all models and media types with an f-score of 0.8 for rhizosphere and 0.97 for endosphere. Thus we can conclude that media-based metabolic modeling provides a holistic view of the metabolome, allowing machine learning algorithms to highlight the differences between and categorize endosphere and rhizosphere bacteria.

"Towards Probabilistic Generative Models Harnessing Graph Neural Networks
  for Disease-Gene Prediction","Disease-gene prediction (DGP) refers to the computational challenge of predicting associations between genes and diseases. Effective solutions to the DGP problem have the potential to accelerate the therapeutic development pipeline at early stages via efficient prioritization of candidate genes for various diseases.

In addition to introducing the VGAE as a promising approach to the DGP problem, we further propose an extension (constrained-VGAE or C-VGAE) which adapts the learning algorithm for link prediction between two distinct node types in heterogeneous graphs. We evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of the VGAE on general link prediction in a disease-gene association network and the C-VGAE on disease-gene prediction in the same network, using popular random walk driven methods as baselines.

"Few-shot Metric Domain Adaptation: Practical Learning Strategies for an
  Automated Plant Disease Diagnosis","Numerous studies have explored image-based automated systems for plant disease diagnosis, demonstrating impressive diagnostic capabilities. However, recent large-scale analyses have revealed a critical limitation: that the diagnostic capability suffers significantly when validated on images captured in environments (domains) differing from those used during training. This shortfall stems from the inherently limited dataset size and the diverse manifestation of disease symptoms, combined with substantial variations in cultivation environments and imaging conditions, such as equipment and composition. These factors lead to insufficient variety in training data, ultimately constraining the system's robustness and generalization. To address these challenges, we propose Few-shot Metric Domain Adaptation (FMDA), a flexible and effective approach for enhancing diagnostic accuracy in practical systems, even when only limited target data is available. FMDA reduces domain discrepancies by introducing a constraint to the diagnostic model that minimizes the ""distance"" between feature spaces of source (training) data and target data with limited samples. FMDA is computationally efficient, requiring only basic feature distance calculations and backpropagation, and can be seamlessly integrated into any machine learning (ML) pipeline. In large-scale experiments, involving 223,015 leaf images across 20 fields and 3 crop species, FMDA achieved F1 score improvements of 11.1 to 29.3 points compared to cases without target data, using only 10 images per disease from the target domain.

"Forecasting Individualized Disease Trajectories using Interpretable Deep
  Learning","Disease progression models are instrumental in predicting individual-level health trajectories and understanding disease dynamics. Existing models are capable of providing either accurate predictions of patients prognoses or clinically interpretable representations of disease pathophysiology, but not both. In this paper, we develop the phased attentive state space (PASS) model of disease progression, a deep probabilistic model that captures complex representations for disease progression while maintaining clinical interpretability. Unlike Markovian state space models which assume memoryless dynamics, PASS uses an attention mechanism to induce ""memoryful"" state transitions, whereby repeatedly updated attention weights are used to focus on past state realizations that best predict future states. This gives rise to complex, non-stationary state dynamics that remain interpretable through the generated attention weights, which designate the relationships between the realized state variables for individual patients.

Forecasting new diseases in low-data settings using transfer learning,"Recent infectious disease outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the Zika epidemic in Brazil, have demonstrated both the importance and difficulty of accurately forecasting novel infectious diseases. When new diseases first emerge, we have little knowledge of the transmission process, the level and duration of immunity to reinfection, or other parameters required to build realistic epidemiological models. Time series forecasts and machine learning, while less reliant on assumptions about the disease, require large amounts of data that are also not available in early stages of an outbreak. In this study, we examine how knowledge of related diseases can help make predictions of new diseases in data-scarce environments using transfer learning. We implement both an empirical and a theoretical approach. Using empirical data from Brazil, we compare how well different machine learning models transfer knowledge between two different disease pairs: (i) dengue and Zika, and (ii) influenza and COVID-19. In the theoretical analysis, we generate data using different transmission and recovery rates with an SIR compartmental model, and then compare the effectiveness of different transfer learning methods. We find that transfer learning offers the potential to improve predictions, even beyond a model based on data from the target disease, though the appropriate source disease must be chosen carefully. While imperfect, these models offer an additional input for decision makers during pandemic response.","Kirstin Roster, Colm Connaughton, Francisco A.

"Graph Convolution Networks Using Message Passing and Multi-Source
  Similarity Features for Predicting circRNA-Disease Association","Graphs can be used to effectively represent complex data structures. Learning these irregular data in graphs is challenging and still suffers from shallow learning. Applying deep learning on graphs has recently showed good performance in many applications in social analysis, bioinformatics etc. A message passing graph convolution network is such a powerful method which has expressive power to learn graph structures. Meanwhile, circRNA is a type of non-coding RNA which plays a critical role in human diseases. Identifying the associations between circRNAs and diseases is important to diagnosis and treatment of complex diseases. However, there are limited number of known associations between them and conducting biological experiments to identify new associations is time consuming and expensive. As a result, there is a need of building efficient and feasible computation methods to predict potential circRNA-disease associations. In this paper, we propose a novel graph convolution network framework to learn features from a graph built with multi-source similarity information to predict circRNA-disease associations. First we use multi-source information of circRNA similarity, disease and circRNA Gaussian Interaction Profile (GIP) kernel similarity to extract the features using first graph convolution.

"Transfer Learning With Densenet201 Architecture Model For Potato Leaf
  Disease Classification","Potato plants are plants that are beneficial to humans. Like other plants in general, potato plants also have diseases; if this disease is not treated immediately, there will be a significant decrease in food production. Therefore, it is necessary to detect diseases quickly and precisely so that disease control can be carried out effectively and efficiently. Classification of potato leaf disease can be done directly. Still, the symptoms cannot always explain the type of disease that attacks potato leaves because there are many types of diseases with symptoms that look the same. Humans also have deficiencies in determining the results of identification of potato leaf disease, so sometimes the results of identification between individuals can be different. Therefore, the use of Deep Learning for the classification process of potato leaf disease is expected to shorten the time and have a high classification accuracy. This study uses a deep learning method with the DenseNet201 architecture. The choice to use the DenseNet201 algorithm in this study is because the model can identify important features of potato leaves and recognize early signs of emerging diseases. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the transfer learning method with the DenseNet201 architecture in increasing the classification accuracy of potato leaf disease compared to traditional classification methods. This study uses two types of scenarios, namely, comparing the number of dropouts and comparing the three optimizers. This test produces the best model using dropout 0.1 and Adam optimizer with an accuracy of 99.5% for training, 95.2% for validation, and 96% for the confusion matrix.

"Feature selection for medical diagnosis: Evaluation for using a hybrid

"Loss-Guided Model Sharing and Local Learning Correction in Decentralized

We conduct extensive experiments using PlantVillage datasets with three deep learning architectures (ResNet50, VGG16, and ViT_B16), analyzing the impact of weighting parameter, the number of shared models, the number of clients, and the use of Loss_val versus Loss_train of other clients.

The abundance of data about disease outbreaks gives scientists an excellent opportunity to uncover patterns in disease spread and make future predictions. However, data over a sizeable geographic area quickly outpace human cognition. Our study area covers a significant portion of the African continent (about 17,885,000 km2). The data size makes computational analysis vital to assist human decision-makers. Methods: We first applied global and local spatial autocorrelation for malaria, cholera, meningitis, and yellow fever case counts. We then used machine learning to predict the weekly presence of these diseases in the second-level administrative district. Lastly, we used machine learning feature importance methods on the variables that affect spread. Results: Our spatial autocorrelation results show that geographic nearness is critical but varies in effect and space. Moreover, we identified many interesting hot and cold spots and spatial outliers. The machine learning model infers a binary class of cases or none with the best F1 score of 0.96 for malaria.

Key research areas in plant science include plant species identification, weed classification using hyper spectral images, monitoring plant health and tracing leaf growth, and the semantic interpretation of leaf information. Botanists easily identify plant species by discriminating between the shape of the leaf, tip, base, leaf margin and leaf vein, as well as the texture of the leaf and the arrangement of leaflets of compound leaves.

We review several image processing methods in the feature extraction of leaves, given that feature extraction is a crucial technique in computer vision. As computers cannot comprehend images, they are required to be converted into features by individually analysing image shapes, colours, textures and moments.

Timely and accurate detection of diseases affecting tomato plants is vital for effective disease management. In this study, we propose a deep learning-based approach for Tomato Leaf Disease Detection using two well-established convolutional neural networks (CNNs), namely VGG19 and Inception v3. The experiment is conducted on the Tomato Villages Dataset, encompassing images of both healthy tomato leaves and leaves afflicted by various diseases. The VGG19 model is augmented with fully connected layers, while the Inception v3 model is modified to incorporate a global average pooling layer and a dense classification layer. Both models are trained on the prepared dataset, and their performances are evaluated on a separate test set. This research employs VGG19 and Inception v3 models on the Tomato Villages dataset (4525 images) for tomato leaf disease detection. The models' accuracy of 93.93% with dropout layers demonstrates their usefulness for crop health monitoring. The paper suggests a deep learning-based strategy that includes normalization, resizing, dataset preparation, and unique model architectures. During training, VGG19 and Inception v3 serve as feature extractors, with possible data augmentation and fine-tuning. Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are obtained through evaluation on a test set and offer important insights into the strengths and shortcomings of the model. The method has the potential for practical use in precision agriculture and could help tomato crops prevent illness early on.","MD Mehraz Hosen, Md.
