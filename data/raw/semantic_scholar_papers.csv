Finding Chaos in Noisy Systems,"In the past twenty years there has been much interest in the physical and biological sciences in nonlinear dynamical systems that appear to have random, unpredictable behavior. One important parameter of a dynamic system is the dominant Lyapunov exponent (LE). When the behavior of the system is compared for two similar initial conditions, this exponent is related to the rate at which the subsequent trajectories diverge. A bounded system with a positive LE is one operational definition of chaotic behavior. Most methods for determining the LE have assumed thousands of observations generated from carefully controlled physical experiments. Less attention has been given to estimating the LE for biological and economic systems that are subjected to random perturbations and observed over a limited amount of time. Using nonparametric regression techniques (Neural Networks and Thin Plate Splines) it is possible to consistently estimate the LE. The properties of these methods have been studied using simulated data and are applied to a biological time series: marten fur returns for the Hudson Bay Company (1820-1900). Based on a nonparametric analysis there is little evidence for lowdimensional chaos in these data. Although these methods appear to work well for systems perturbed by small amounts of noise, finding chaos in a system with a significant stochastic component may be difficult.","Douglas Nychkatl, S.

EfficientNet: Rethinking Model Scaling for Convolutional Neural Networks,"Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) are commonly developed at a fixed resource budget, and then scaled up for better accuracy if more resources are available. In this paper, we systematically study model scaling and identify that carefully balancing network depth, width, and resolution can lead to better performance. Based on this observation, we propose a new scaling method that uniformly scales all dimensions of depth/width/resolution using a simple yet highly effective compound coefficient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on scaling up MobileNets and ResNet. 
To go even further, we use neural architecture search to design a new baseline network and scale it up to obtain a family of models, called EfficientNets, which achieve much better accuracy and efficiency than previous ConvNets. In particular, our EfficientNet-B7 achieves state-of-the-art 84.4% top-1 / 97.1% top-5 accuracy on ImageNet, while being 8.4x smaller and 6.1x faster on inference than the best existing ConvNet. Our EfficientNets also transfer well and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on CIFAR-100 (91.7%), Flowers (98.8%), and 3 other transfer learning datasets, with an order of magnitude fewer parameters.

How Powerful are Graph Neural Networks?,"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are an effective framework for representation learning of graphs. GNNs follow a neighborhood aggregation scheme, where the representation vector of a node is computed by recursively aggregating and transforming representation vectors of its neighboring nodes. Many GNN variants have been proposed and have achieved state-of-the-art results on both node and graph classification tasks. However, despite GNNs revolutionizing graph representation learning, there is limited understanding of their representational properties and limitations. Here, we present a theoretical framework for analyzing the expressive power of GNNs to capture different graph structures. Our results characterize the discriminative power of popular GNN variants, such as Graph Convolutional Networks and GraphSAGE, and show that they cannot learn to distinguish certain simple graph structures. We then develop a simple architecture that is provably the most expressive among the class of GNNs and is as powerful as the Weisfeiler-Lehman graph isomorphism test. We empirically validate our theoretical findings on a number of graph classification benchmarks, and demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance.","Keyulu Xu, Weihua Hu, J.

MobileNets: Efficient Convolutional Neural Networks for Mobile Vision Applications,"We present a class of efficient models called MobileNets for mobile and embedded vision applications. MobileNets are based on a streamlined architecture that uses depth-wise separable convolutions to build light weight deep neural networks. We introduce two simple global hyper-parameters that efficiently trade off between latency and accuracy. These hyper-parameters allow the model builder to choose the right sized model for their application based on the constraints of the problem. We present extensive experiments on resource and accuracy tradeoffs and show strong performance compared to other popular models on ImageNet classification. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of MobileNets across a wide range of applications and use cases including object detection, finegrain classification, face attributes and large scale geo-localization.","Andrew G.

On Calibration of Modern Neural Networks,"Confidence calibration -- the problem of predicting probability estimates representative of the true correctness likelihood -- is important for classification models in many applications. We discover that modern neural networks, unlike those from a decade ago, are poorly calibrated. Through extensive experiments, we observe that depth, width, weight decay, and Batch Normalization are important factors influencing calibration. We evaluate the performance of various post-processing calibration methods on state-of-the-art architectures with image and document classification datasets. Our analysis and experiments not only offer insights into neural network learning, but also provide a simple and straightforward recipe for practical settings: on most datasets, temperature scaling -- a single-parameter variant of Platt Scaling -- is surprisingly effective at calibrating predictions.","Chuan Guo, Geoff Pleiss, Yu Sun, Kilian Q.
